<p class="map-notes">Specimen 401’s species has been spotted in deep oceans across the world (blue), only missing from the furthest north oceans near the Arctic Circle, and more inland seas such as the Mediterranean.</p>

    <h2>Biology / Environment</h2>

    <p class="gw-text">From the outside alone, its biology reads like a masterclass in elegant adaptation. Its immense, streamlined body moves with a grace that seems impossible for something of its size, and those elongated pectoral fins—nearly a third of its total length—give it a distinctive, almost winged silhouette as it glides through the water. Along its jawline sit long, flexible keratin structures that appear to act as sieves, allowing this gentle giant to engulf clouds of tiny prey and filter them with casual ease. Each observation session leaves me marveling not only at its physical adaptations, but at how harmoniously these features work together—an intricate, visible biology that hints at countless inner secrets we’ve yet to uncover.</p>

    <p class="dr-text">Indeed Gladys, Specimen 401’s environment has shaped it into a creature exquisitely tuned to the challenges of the open ocean. The deep pelagic zones demand efficiency, endurance, and an ability to navigate vast, shifting ecosystems, and this giant meets those demands with remarkable finesse. The baleen structures you described are not only marvels of feeding anatomy but also perfect adaptations to a habitat where food often occurs in unpredictable, drifting swarms. Even its sweeping migrations—spanning thousands of miles—reflect a sophisticated response to seasonal shifts in temperature and resource availability. Every behavioral pattern we’ve documented reinforces the same message: Specimen 401 is not merely surviving in its environment, but thriving through a suite of finely honed ecological strategies.</p>

    <h2>Encounter Notes</h2>
    <p class="derek-text">Excerpt from the Field Journal of Derek von Stone: “Nothing—and I mean nothing—prepares you for meeting the Leviathan. I was out on the open water at dawn, the sea flat as hammered metal, when the surface erupted beside my boat like a mountain forcing its way up from the deep. The creature surged upward, its massive body streaked with scars and barnacles that told stories older than any of us. And then it crashed down, dowsing me in seawater. It circled once, eyeing me with that deep, knowing gaze creatures of the abyss seem to share. For a moment, I swear it recognized me—not as a threat, not as prey, but as another traveler passing through its endless domain. Then, with barely a ripple, it descended, leaving only silence and a very humbled explorer drifting in its wake.”</p>
