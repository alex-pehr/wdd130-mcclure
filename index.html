        <h3>Derek Von Stone – Lead Field Adventurer</h3>
        <p>As the team’s expedition leader, I bring years of hands-on experience navigating some of the world’s most remote and treacherous landscapes. After earning my degree in Applied Exploration Sciences—yes, it’s a real program, and yes, I graduated top of my class—I committed myself to charting the blank spaces on the map that most researchers only theorize about. My specialty lies in on-site identification, tracking, and retrieval of data on elusive species, and I’ve built a reputation for charging head-first into the unknown with confidence, precision, and a healthy disregard for the phrase “not recommended.” Whether scaling cliffs or pushing through unmapped forests, I thrive where the ordinary ends, making me uniquely qualified to lead our search for cryptids hiding just beyond the edges of civilization.</p>

        <h3>Gladys White – Biological Research Specialist</h3>
        <p>I’ve devoted my career to understanding the marvelous complexities of life, from the smallest cellular processes to the staggering diversity of animal physiology. With a master’s degree in Integrative Biology and several years of field-lab hybrid research experience, I focus on documenting and analyzing the biological traits of the extraordinary organisms our team encounters. What excites me most is uncovering how these unfamiliar creatures function—how they move, adapt, survive, and thrive in environments we’re only beginning to understand. I approach every discovery with scientific rigor and genuine enthusiasm, ensuring that each specimen we encounter is studied with care, curiosity, and a deep respect for the remarkable systems at work within them.</p>

        <h3>Dr. Frank Erickson – Environmental Ecologist</h3>
        <p>As the team’s environmental specialist, my work centers on understanding how newly documented species interact with their surrounding ecosystems. I hold a PhD in Ecology and Environmental Systems, and my research for the past decade has focused on habitat dynamics, food-web modeling, and ecological resilience. Whenever our expeditions uncover a previously unknown organism, my role is to investigate the environmental conditions that support it and determine how it fits into—or disrupts—the broader ecological balance. I take a measured, evidence-driven approach to every field study, ensuring that our findings contribute not only to scientific knowledge but also to a deeper understanding of the hidden connections that shape our natural world.</p>
