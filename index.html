        <h3>Derek Von Stone – Lead Field Adventurer</h3>
        <p>
            As the team’s expedition leader, I bring years of hands-on experience navigating some of 
            the world’s most remote and treacherous landscapes. After earning my degree in Applied 
            Exploration Sciences—yes, it’s a real program, and yes, I graduated top of my class—I 
            committed myself to charting the blank spaces on the map that most researchers only 
            theorize about. My specialty lies in on-site identification, tracking, and retrieval 
            of data on elusive species, and I’ve built a reputation for charging head-first into 
            the unknown with confidence, precision, and a healthy disregard for the phrase 
            “not recommended.” Whether scaling cliffs or pushing through unmapped forests, I thrive 
            where the ordinary ends, making me uniquely qualified to lead our search for cryptids 
            hiding just beyond the edges of civilization.

        <h3>Gladys White – Biological Research Specialist</h3>
        <p>
            I’ve devoted my career to understanding the marvelous complexities of life, from the 
            smallest cellular processes to the staggering diversity of animal physiology. With a 
            master’s degree in Integrative Biology and several years of field-lab hybrid research 
            experience, I focus on documenting and analyzing the biological traits of the 
            extraordinary organisms our team encounters. What excites me most is uncovering how 
            these unfamiliar creatures function—how they move, adapt, survive, and thrive in 
            environments we’re only beginning to understand. I approach every discovery with 
            scientific rigor and genuine enthusiasm, ensuring that each specimen we encounter is 
            studied with care, curiosity, and a deep respect for the remarkable systems at work 
            within them.

        <h3>Dr. Frank Erickson – Environmental Ecologist</h3>
        <p>
            As the team’s environmental specialist, my work centers on understanding how newly 
            documented species interact with their surrounding ecosystems. I hold a PhD in Ecology 
            and Environmental Systems, and my research for the past decade has focused on habitat 
            dynamics, food-web modeling, and ecological resilience. Whenever our expeditions 
            uncover a previously unknown organism, my role is to investigate the environmental 
            conditions that support it and determine how it fits into—or disrupts—the broader 
            ecological balance. I take a measured, evidence-driven approach to every field study, 
            ensuring that our findings contribute not only to scientific knowledge but also to a 
            deeper understanding of the hidden connections that shape our natural world.
