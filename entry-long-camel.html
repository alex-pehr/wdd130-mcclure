        Specimen 245’s species has been tracked in only certain parts of North and South Africa (red),
        likely due to better availability in their food sources or shrinking numbers due to predators.

        Its elongated neck, a marvel of vertebrate design, rises like a living periscope, giving it 
        access to treetop resources no other land creature can reach. The powerful legs, at once 
        slender and strong, move with a rolling grace that belies their height. Even Specimen 245’s 
        patterned coat fascinates me—those irregular patches map out intricate networks of cooling 
        and camouflage that help regulate its massive body. And then there are the eyes: enormous, 
        gentle, and perched so high that they seem to survey entire horizons at a glance. Every 
        detail feels like a celebration of vertical living.

        My, I didn’t know you were such a fan, Gladys. Is this what the kids call ‘being a horse girl’?  
        At any rate, Specimen 245’s environment tells us exactly why it evolved to such staggering 
        proportions. In the sprawling savannas and open woodlands it inhabits, height is an enormous 
        ecological advantage—one that allows access to untouched food sources and provides visual 
        dominance over predators and terrain alike. Its long strides, steady and economical, are 
        perfectly suited to the vast distances it must travel between water and seasonal feeding 
        grounds. Even its coat, which you described with such excitement, mirrors the dappled 
        interplay of sun and shade found beneath sparse tree canopies, offering surprising 
        concealment for an animal so large. Each adaptation speaks to the pressures of a landscape 
        defined by openness, competition, and seasonal scarcity. The Sky-Walker thrives not in spite 
        of these challenges, but because its every feature has been sculpted to meet them.

    <h3>Encounter Report</h3>
    <p>
        Excerpt from the Field Journal of Derek von Stone:<br>
        “Today’s trek across the savanna brought me face-to-knees with the towering legend 
        locals call the Long Camel. The name undersells it—this creature is a walking watchtower, 
        all legs and neck and effortless confidence. I spotted one browsing from a treetop like it 
        was plucking fruit from a pantry shelf. When it finally noticed me, it bent that impossible 
        neck down in a slow, deliberate sweep, studying me with those wide, thoughtful eyes. Most 
        beasts either run or charge, but the Long Camel just… considered me, like it was evaluating 
        whether I was interesting enough to remember. Then, with a lazy flick of its tail, it 
        strolled off, covering more ground in a minute than I could in ten. I’ve battled through 
        jungles and deserts, but I’ve never felt as small—and strangely honored—as when the Long 
        Camel acknowledged me and carried on with its day.”
