        Multiple encounters with Specimen 312 on the eastern edge of Australia and the island

        can be found there as well, but this remains unconfirmed.

        sweeps through the current with surprising sensitivity...

        From an ecological standpoint, Specimen 312 occupies a remarkably specialized niche

        range provide not only protection but also an abundance of invertebrate life...
